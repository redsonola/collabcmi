Using nom as a package manager. 
First Install nvm (node version manager)

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script

nvm install 15.1.0

Install mkcert
eg. on OS X -- brew install mkcert
If you have homebrew, which I recommend. 

Then, on the command-line:
npm install
npm run mkcert

Then, to run/build:
npm run start

Main js file: App2.svelte

Note: There is an old main.js file but that is depreciated. & no longer used.

Brent has been using storybook to do prototyping, so if you like that:
npm run storybook
will run the the storybook files and you can use that.
